				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>We would like to inform you about new features available that simplify the access to the serial port of FIT IoT-LAB nodes .</p>
<h3>Direct access via the testbed webportal</h3>
<p>It is now possible to access the serial port of all nodes but the A8 from the experiment details page on the testbed webportal.<br />
Each node in an experiment now provides a <i>terminal icon</i> in the list of supported actions: just click on it and a web terminal pops up with direct access to the serial port of the node.</p>
<p>This makes the user experience as simple as possible when using FIT IoT-LAB via the testbed webportal!</p>
<p>There are things to take into account though:</p>
<ul>
<li>The access to the serial port is similar to the netcat access on port 20000 from the SSH frontends: only one TCP connection at a time is possible. This means that you cannot use the web terminal if a TCP connection is already opened using netcat. And vice-versa.</li>
<li>The serial stream transport uses a websocket connection between the browser and the FIT IoT-LAB web server. For performance reasons, only 2 websocket connections on a single node are allowed at a time and 10 websocket connections per site per user in total are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discover this new feature by following our <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/tutorials/getting-started-tutorial/">new getting started tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>New websocket CLI Tools</h3>
<p>The access to the node serial port via websockets also makes it possible to aggregate serial input/output of nodes from different sites on a single computer. To do this, we released a new CLI tool: the <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/ws-cli-tools">ws-cli-tools</a>.<br />
It is open source, compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 and available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/iotlabwscli/">PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>Just follow the <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/ws-cli-tools/blob/master/README.rst">README</a> on github to learn how to install and use it with the FIT IoT-LAB testbed.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve added Le Cube, a space for heterogeneous interoperability &amp; compatibility </p>
<p>For now, we&#8217;ve deployed nodes that are capable of 802.15.4 in both 2.4 GHz and sub-GHz, nodes using BLE, and nodes using LoRa. They all coexist in a small vicinity:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 m3 nodes</li>
<li>5 firefly nodes</li>
<li>5 st-lrwan1 nodes</li>
<li>5 microbit nodes</li>
<li>5 samr21 nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The panel of offered MCUs and radio chipsets is intended to grow (total available 64 gateways), and can include your own boards, just follow our <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab-gateway/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md">documentation</a> on the iot-lab-gateway repository to start, and we&#8217;ll be glad to physically plug them in LeCube. </p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy working with this new space.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>We are very happy to announce the release of a new batch of 46 open nodes on the Saclay site of IoT-LAB.</p>
<p>With these new nodes, the possibilities already provided by IoT-LAB are even more extended:<br />
&#8211; The are nodes from different vendors: NXP, Microchip, ST, Nordic, Phytec, etc<br />
&#8211; The nodes provide different radios: 802.15.4, BLE, WiFi, Sub-GHz</p>
<p>The nodes with 802.15.4 radio are deployed in the same room in order to allow developers testing wireless connectivity between heterogeneous platforms. Nodes with BLE radios are deployed in another room and are quite close to each other.<br />
For more details on the deployment, please have a look at the <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/deployment/saclay/">Saclay site deployment page</a>.</p>
<p>We recall that adding support for new nodes can be done by anyone: just follow our <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab-gateway/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md">documentation</a> on the iot-lab-gateway repository.</p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy working with these new open nodes.</p>

<p>After the addition of SAMR21 and LoRa nodes we want to formally announce the<br />
availability of new types of boards on some IoT-LAB sites, which will permit<br />
a wider range of possibilities on the testbed.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>9 Zolertia Firefly boards</strong>, featuring two radios (2.4 GHz 802.15.4 Zigbee and<br />
sub-GHz), have been deployed on the Lille site. They are deployed throughout<br />
the building and, depending on the firmware you flash, will enable heterogeneous<br />
networking with co-located regular M3 nodes. A new tutorial demonstrating the short and<br />
long range capabilities is available on the IoT-LAB website [1]</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>3 Arduino Zero boards</strong> with XBee shields have been deployed on the Saclay site.<br />
They are close to the existing M3 and SAMR21 nodes and thus allow to test<br />
802.15.4 (2.4GHz) interoperability between different types of radio. A new<br />
tutorial showing the use of networking capabilities of RIOT on these boards is<br />
also available on the IoT-LAB website [2]</p>
<p>If you have some hardware that you would like to see deployed on Iot-LAB, check<br />
out this documentation [3] to implement the initial support and we will help<br />
you to finalize the on site deployment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>We would like to inform you about tools updates we made on the IoT-LAB SSH frontends.</p>
<h3>GNU Toolchain for ARM</h3>
<p>Version 7.2 of the GNU Toolchain for ARM is now installed in /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major in addition to the actual one, version 4.9, which is still used by default. To know more on how to use it or set it as the default version, see the <a href="https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab/wiki/Versions-of-the-GNU-toolchain-for-ARM">IoT-LAB wiki</a>.</p>
<h3>IoT-LAB CLI Tools</h3>
<p>For a better user experience, we released a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/iotlabcli/">new version of IoT-LAB command-line tools</a> (v2.5.3). It mainly consists in renaming, adding a common prefix to the different commands.</p>
<p>Thus now you should use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iotlab-experiment</strong> (experiment-cli)</li>
<li><strong>iotlab-node</strong> (node-cli)</li>
<li><strong>iotlab-profile</strong> (profile-cli)</li>
<li><strong>iotlab-auth</strong> (auth-cli)</li>
<li><strong>iotlab-robot</strong> (robot-cli)</li>
<li><strong>iotlab-ssh</strong> (open-a8-cli)</li>
</ul>
<p>All legacy names are always available to ensure compatibility with old scripts and tools. A deprecated message is printed when using legacy commands.<br />
Of course you are encouraged to update.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>We are proud to announce the availability of the Lille new deployment: sparser, at the building scale. The whole 256 M3 nodes are available again*.<br />
But that’s not all. We took advantage of this operation to add a new type of board in this deployment. We deployed 9 Zolertia Frirefly (3 per floor), bringing sub-1GHz communications alongside 2.4GHz.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br />
In its original deployment, released in 2014, the Lille nodes were deployed over a 225 m2 area, hosting 256 M3 nodes. The nodes were dispatched over a regular 2D-grid, plus a few number deployed vertically on wooden poles.</p>
<p>The main drawback of this deployment was the density of the network – each node was able to communicate directly with any other node. Thus, we considered beneficial to propose an actual multi-hop network where the nodes are not all in range of each other. That is why we decided to make our deployment sparser and re-deploy more than half of the nodes.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong><br />
The final scenario adopted is, in addition to the original dedicated room on the third floor, a distribution of nodes through offices, corridors, meeting or storage rooms across the three floors of our Inria Lille building, providing a connected network. Figures attached shows an overview of the new topology. Furthermore, offering such a topology, provides an actual deployment at a building scale.<br />
Details, maps and pictures will be updated soon on the <a href="/deployment/lille">Lille&#8217;s deployment page</a>.</p>
<p>We hope it will answer your needs and experimentation scenarios.</p>
<p><small><em>*Be careful, coordinates of the nodes changed, and nodes ids too. Thus, experiments conduct with the same set of nodes ids, will not be ran with the same nodes and could bring different results than before.</em></small></p>
